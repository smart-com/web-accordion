        By not having the imagination to imagine what the content "might" be, a design 
        consideration is lost. Meaning becomes obfuscated because "it's just text", 
        understandability gets compromised because nobody realized that this text stuff was 
        actually meant to be read. Opportunities get lost because the lorem ipsum garbage that 
        you used instead of real content didn't suggest opportunities. The text then gets made 
        really small, because, it's not meant to be used, we might as well create loads of that 
        lovely white space.
